This directory stores encrypted keystore files for Foundry deployment accounts.  

- Files matching `*.json` / `*.keystore` are ignored by git for safety.  
- Use `cast wallet import hypurr-deployer --interactive --keystore wallets/hypurr-deployer.json` to generate a password-protected file locally.  
- Never commit the generated keystore or share your password.  

Only this README is tracked to keep the folder in version control.
